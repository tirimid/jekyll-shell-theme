# jekyll-shell-theme

## Introduction

This is a fork of [jekyll-shell-theme by tareqdandachi](https://github.com/itstorque/jekyll-shell-theme),
with some minor changes and removals for use on my website. For an average site,
you should probably just use the original. This is a stripped down, more
utilitarian version with only support for what a minimalist site might need.

## Fork changes

* Added license statement in footer (for things like CC)
* Removed GitHub and Twitter profile links in footer
* Removed page name in footer
* Reversed page title format
* Removed ability of pages to load Javascript code
* Removed all layouts except for `default`
* Removed rounded corners around code blocks
* Reduced line height
* Added publishing information on pages
* Added large title on pages
* Changed header page title to site title
* Made blockquotes boxed instead of indented
